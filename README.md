# ATM SECURITY SYSTEM
<p align="left">This project presents an Arduino-based ATM security system utilizing a vibration sensor, an alarm, and a servomotor.
The system is designed to detect unauthorized access attempts to the ATM room. Upon detecting vibrations or tampering,
the vibration sensor triggers an alarm to alert nearby personnel or authorities. Simultaneously, a servomotor mechanism
is activated to physically close the door of the ATM room, preventing the thief from escaping. The Arduino microcontroller serves as the central
processing unit, coordinating sensor inputs and actuator outputs to ensure timely and effective response to security threats.
This project not only demonstrates the integration of hardware components for enhanced security but also highlights the application of Arduino in real-world security systems.</p>
